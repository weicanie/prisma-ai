# How Should a Resume Be Written

This project adopts strong resume quality metrics and workflows inspired by CoderWhy, designed for IT roles.

## Design Philosophy: doro

do

- directed-oriented: target your project experience, its highlights, and the role itself
- development-oriented: not only solve immediate issues, but also support long-term career growth
  <br>

ro

- result-oriented: aim for interviews and offers; focus on practical outcomes
- refine-oriented: deeply mine and refine highlights to raise resume quality; also improve learning quality for offer-oriented study

## The Essence of Job Hunting

Job hunting is getting interviews via resume screening, then getting the offer via interviews.
<br>

What’s the core?

<br>

Compatibility, matching, and winning.
<br>

Compatibility and matching mean you fit the role’s target persona.
<br>

How is a role defined? Companies build a candidate persona based on real needs, then publish the role accordingly. Therefore, achieving compatibility and matching is critical.


Winning means standing out among candidates for that role.

So aside from static attributes like education—and excluding rare top-tier publications or major awards—it really comes down to your internship/work experience.
<br>

Whether internship or full-time, the keys to winning are 1) better fit (compatibility/matching) and 2) strong highlights.
<br>

Common pitfalls: piling up routine business and tech without highlights, leaving interviewers with nothing compelling to probe.
<br>

Some resumes list technical highlights but lack depth, and miss two crucial dimensions.
<br>

One is contribution to the team—often overlooked but extremely important.
<br>

Bluntly: modern work is team-based. Companies want high‑quality “components.” If you can demonstrate team contribution, that’s a big plus.
<br>

If tech doesn’t serve the team and users, what’s the point?

The other is business value/user experience.

In short, highlights should be well-rounded across all three dimensions to make a sufficiently strong resume.

This project’s AI provides solid support and foundations in these areas. Understanding the why behind the outputs helps you leverage AI better.
