# Integrate deepwiki Knowledge Base

The https://deepwiki.com service: input a project repository URL and get generated project documentation.
<br/>
First, generate docs for your repo on https://deepwiki.com. Then use the site download and knowledge base upload features provided by this project to import the deepwiki site into your project knowledge base.
<br/>
Downloaded docs are stored in the project root under the project_wikis directory. You can edit, add, or delete files there and then upload again to the knowledge base.
