# Why and How to Use Anki

## Why use Anki

Anki is a spaced-repetition memory tool based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve and active recall. It schedules your next review intelligently based on mastery, achieving strong retention with minimal repetitions.

### Core principles

1.  Spaced Repetition:

    - Theory: The forgetting rate is “fast first, then slow.” Early after learning, you forget quickly; with each successful review, forgetting slows.
    - In Anki: After you learn an item (e.g., an interview question), Anki reminds you right before you’re likely to forget. If you recall successfully, the next interval expands (1 day → 3 days → 1 week → 1 month...). This consolidates memory at the right time and avoids over-reviewing or full re-learning after forgetting.

2.  Active Recall:
    - Theory: Actively retrieving information strengthens connections and deepens memory better than passive reading or listening.
    - In Anki: Cards are question on the front, answer on the back. You think first, then check and verify. This strenuous retrieval is far more effective than reading answers directly.

### Summary

By combining a scientific review algorithm with enforced active recall, Anki frees your brain from “what to review and when,” letting you focus on understanding and reasoning—greatly improving learning and interview prep efficiency.

Without Anki, you won’t know when to review, leading to too-early or too-late reviews—or none at all—so you’ll spend more time mastering the same material.

## How to use Anki

### Key points

To get the most from Anki for interview prep, note these:

1.  Craft high-quality cards (Minimum Information Principle):

    - Atomize: each card contains one minimal concept. Don’t put a big question like “Explain TCP three-way handshake and four-way teardown” on one card. Split into: “What’s the purpose of the first handshake?”, “Why is the third handshake needed?”, “What is the role of TIME_WAIT?”, etc.
    - Question-first: front = question, back = answer. Avoid mere info lists to enforce active recall.
    - Use context/cues: images, code blocks, or brief hints can aid comprehension and recall.

2.  Be honest in self-assessment:

    - When reviewing, choose Again/Hard/Good/Easy truthfully. If you just “feel” you know it but can’t articulate it, choose Again or Hard so Anki increases frequency. Self-deception reduces efficiency.

3.  Use it daily:

    - The power of spaced repetition lies in consistency. Spend 15–30 minutes daily. Skipping causes backlog and hurts scheduling accuracy.

4.  Understand, don’t cram:

    - Anki aids memory; it doesn’t replace thinking. Ensure you truly understand principles, scenarios, and trade-offs before making cards. Understanding enables flexible application in interviews.

5.  Iterate and improve:

    - Your deck evolves. As your understanding deepens or a card proves weak, revise, split, or refine it.
