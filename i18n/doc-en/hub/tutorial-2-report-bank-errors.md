# Report Errors in the Question Bank

The interview questions in the [hub](https://pinkprisma.com) are collaboratively built and shared by all users. Due to the nature of AI-generated content, mistakes may occasionally occur.
<br/>

All questions in the hub follow semantic versioning, starting from v1.0.0.
<br/>

We provide an issue template specifically for correcting questions.
<br/>

If you find an error in a question, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/weicanie/prisma-ai/issues) and include the question title, a description of the error, and your correction (optional).
<br/>

Each question includes documentation provenance. If an answer seems suspicious, feel free to read the original documentation and include suggested corrections in your issue whenever possible.
<br/>

Your feedback helps us and the community continually improve the quality of the questions, ultimately benefiting you and many others.
