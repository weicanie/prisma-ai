- **You have two versions of your project experience**
  - Local: your own project experience on your machine—this is what ultimately goes into your resume.
  - Database: the uploaded project experience—the AI optimizes this version.
- **Borrow from AI**
  - Refer to the AI's output and modify your local project experience
    - **Analysis → Optimization**
    - **Highlight Mining**
      - Newly achieved highlights: definitely include them
      - Not yet achieved but you know how to implement: can also be included
- **Flow**

  - Optimize the project experience stored in the database

    - Loop: analyze and optimize until satisfied
    - Loop: mine highlights until satisfied
    - Single round: pick a highlight you want to implement and do it

  - After AI finishes generating, you can use Feedback to have AI redo it. Your feedback helps AI do better next time!

## 3. Procedures

Click the corresponding buttons.

### 3.1 Loop: Analyze and Optimize

Identify issues and fix them.
After optimization, you can analyze again—repeat until satisfied.
Note: lack of highlights can only be solved via subsequent highlight mining.

When no analysis has been done yet, the first button is Analyze:

After analysis, it becomes Optimize.

After optimization, it becomes Analyze again.

Thus you can loop until satisfied.

### 3.2 Loop: Highlight Mining

Mine the highlights of your project experience.
You can keep digging until you’re satisfied.
