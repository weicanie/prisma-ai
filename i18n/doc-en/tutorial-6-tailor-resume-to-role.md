# Tailor Your Resume for Target Roles

## Why tailor your resume to specific roles?

What’s the core of job hunting?

<br>

Compatibility, matching, and winning.
<br>

Compatibility and matching mean you fit the profile of the person the role is hiring for.
<br>

Winning means you stand out among candidates for that role.

How does a role come about? A company builds a candidate persona based on real needs, then publishes the job accordingly.

Therefore, achieving compatibility and matching is paramount. For example, if you want a backend role in payments or a frontend role focused on visualization,
<br>
would a backend engineer focused on cloud-native be hired for this role? Would a frontend engineer focused on internal admin systems be hired for this role?

Also, don’t be excessively anxious about your educational background. Unless your target role is set too high, other candidates won’t crush you purely on education.
<br>

For workforce stability, roles typically won’t hire beyond their band. Hiring a 985 master’s graduate at 8–9k is risky—if they’re just bridging to a government exam or another role, they’ll leave soon. If anyone can do it, why hire someone unstable?

<br>

You might ask: I’m excellent and my resume is already great—why tailor anything? I’ll crush it.

<br>

Regardless of how confident you are, the reality is: if you don’t match the role, you won’t even pass the ATS screen.

How strong are you if you can’t even get an interview?

From getting interviews to offer-in-hand, matching runs through the entire process.

Otherwise, why would they interview so many? Just pick whoever ranks higher in ACM, right? (An analogy.)

<br>

The mechanics of hiring dictate: matching first; mass applications don’t work.

<br>

You might ask: there are so many roles—how can I tailor for each?
<br>

I’ve memorized so many Q&A that my brain hurts, and LeetCode has exhausted me.

<br>

This is exactly where AI helps.

## How to tailor your resume for a role

By now you should have used the crawler + job matching to get roles that match you reasonably well.
<br>

So you just need adjustments. In short: extract the keywords for hard and soft requirements from the role, then add/remove/edit and optimize the wording in your resume.
<br>

You can do this conveniently on the Jobs page in the client.

The resume will be prepared for you, but you may not actually have everything in it. Apply the suggestions pragmatically to your real resume.
<br>

Why did it add technologies I haven’t learned?
<br>

That indicates room to improve your match to the role’s technical requirements.

Technical depth is tiered, for example:

- Use: understand and use common APIs
- Familiar: understand and be familiar with most APIs
- Master: dive into source and grasp internals
- Customize: read source thoroughly and customize as needed

Does the role require you to master everything? Unlikely.
<br>

For most technologies, getting to “use” takes a week or two.
<br>

You can reference the role’s “familiar/understand/master” wording, but don’t take it literally—standards vary; discussions clarify expectations.

Advice: decide based on your time and the tech’s popularity, for example:

- If it can be learned in 1–2 weeks: do it
- If it takes very long: be cautious

## Experiment

You likely have more than one phone number (if not, family members do), and you can create alternate accounts in job apps.
<br>

Use an alt account to submit test resumes and chat more with HR.
<br>

Like an A/B test: try multiple variable combinations and the insights will emerge.
