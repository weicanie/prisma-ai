## üéØ Why Prisma-AI

Prisma-AI solves the 4 biggest headaches in your job search:

1.  **Projects lack highlights**: You can only list technical terms but can't explain the substance.
    - Use AI to delve into your experience, automatically generate "actionable" highlight plans, and collaborate with you to implement them.
2.  **Resume doesn't fit**: You've sent out many applications with no response.
    - Built-in job scraping + local vector model for precise filtering of matching positions; automatically customizes your resume for each job.
3.  **Can't learn interview questions**: You memorize, forget, and repeat.
    - A combination of question banks, mind maps, and Anki helps you understand and remember, ensuring steady progress without anxiety.
4.  **Interview experiences have no answers**: Reading them only increases anxiety.
    - AI automatically completes and structures information, extracts interview questions and standard answers, and supports version control and collaborative iteration.
